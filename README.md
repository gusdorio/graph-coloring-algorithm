## This project have as approach create an algorithm to coloring a graph with a n given number of nodes and colors, in a way that adjacenty nodes cannot have the same color. 

The algorithm must have the capability of seeing if the gien number of colors given by a user can do the job mentioned and, also see the minimun number of colors needed to acomplish this task (both in the two possible cases, when the number of colors not is sufficient, and when the given number was sufficious).

###  The project is separeted in two general models:

- notebook.ipynb ; to run our graph code and visualize it, using jupyter.

- algorithm.py ; where the logical algorithm is. the notebook will use this as a module.



### To run all required libs of this project, you can run in your enviroment:     
>$pip install -r requirements.txt
